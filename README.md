## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties




### What I learned
This is my first website ill ever create, i hope to get better, I learnt how this code tells a web browser how to read text on a webpage, it is very crucial. i also got to know more about css styles.
```html
 <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <Meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!--displays site properly based on user's device--> 
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development
this is just a first step for me, i still want to focus more on learning html tags and numerous css styles, to know when and where to use them before proceeding to JS


### Useful resources
